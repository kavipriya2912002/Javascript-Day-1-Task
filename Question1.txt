Blog on difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP 2.

HTTP helps the user to send the request to the server and receive the response from the server.

HTTP1.1 :
1} HTTP1.1 was created to the web pages containing some html markup and an image or two. But now a days web pages contains 
hundreds of resources with image,fonts,web style sheets etc.
2} HTTP1.1 was not designed to endow such big loads like many images and other resources.It'll take more time to load the page.
3) HTTP1.1 transfers all the requests and response in the plain text format.
4) HTTP1.1 is slow when compared to HTTP2.
5) HTTP1.1 loads all the resources one by one, if any resource is not loaded it blocks all the remaining resources.
6) HTTP1.1 doesn't use any method like HPACK to compress the header to improve performance so it'll take more time to load
 when compared to HTTP2.


HTTP2 :
1) HTTP2 is faster and efficient when compared to HTTP1.1.
2) One of the reason behind HTTP2 being faster is prioritizing contents during the loading process.It compresses the HTTP headers and 
allows for several push which can send resources to the browser before the HTML document is even completely parsed.
3) HTTP2 uses a single TCP connection to send multiple data in a single time and it is called multiplexing.
4) HTTP2 transfers all the data in binary format.
5) To speed up the loading process by making it small both the HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 uses the compression method. firstly it compresses the header
 to make it small to improve the performance.For this HTTP2 uses the most advanced compression method called HPACK so that it'll take less time 
 to load the page.
